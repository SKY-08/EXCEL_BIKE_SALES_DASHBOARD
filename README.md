# Bike Sales Dashboard (Excel)

This project presents an interactive **Bike Sales Dashboard** built using **Microsoft Excel**. The dashboard visualizes sales data with the goal of analyzing key customer demographics, their purchasing behaviors, and how different factors like income, age, region, and other variables influence bike purchases.

The dataset includes various customer attributes such as marital status, gender, income, education level, occupation, and more. These attributes help provide insights into which factors are most correlated with the decision to purchase a bike.

## Key Insights:
The dashboard provides visual insights into the relationship between various customer attributes and their bike purchase behavior. Some key insights include:
- **Demographic Breakdown**: Insights into the marital status, gender, and age groups of customers who purchased bikes.
- **Income and Purchase Correlation**: Analyzing whether income level influences bike purchase decisions.
- **Home Ownership and Car Ownership**: Visualizing how home and car ownership relate to the likelihood of purchasing a bike.
- **Commute Distance**: Analyzing how commute distance influences bike purchases.
- **Regional Trends**: Identifying which regions have higher bike purchase rates.
- **Education and Occupation Influence**: Understanding how education level and occupation impact bike purchase behavior.

## Techniques Used:
- **Pivot Tables**: Aggregating and summarizing data for analysis, including breakdowns by region, income level, and age group.
- **Charts and Graphs**: Visualizing data using bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and scatter plots to highlight trends and relationships.
- **Conditional Formatting**: Highlighting key metrics, such as the percentage of customers who purchased bikes, using conditional formatting.
- **Filters and Slicers**: Adding interactive filters to allow users to explore data based on different demographic factors, such as age, income, or region.
